# ML Mini Projects
These projects were all written for an ML course, in order to gain a better grasp of the fundamentals of machine learning. Projects include:

1. [Building a hard-coded perceptron from scratch using MXNet NDArrays](./ml-from-scratch/perceptron.ipynb)
2. [Building a hard-coded Naive Bayes Classifier from scratch using only pandas and native python structures](./ml-from-scratch/naive-bayes.ipynb)
3. [Building a set of Convolutional Neural nets (CNNs) using MXNet](./cnns/cnns-with-gluon.ipynb). One piece of this project was to build and and then tune the parameters of a CNN in order to classify images of clothing items from the [FashionMNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist). The second piece of the project was to build a more sophisticated CNN, by applying transfer learning, to classify between images of Cats and Dogs.
4. [Building a series of Reinforcement Learning algorithms using native python](./reinforcment/reinforcement_learning.ipynb)
